# Twelve21.PasswordStorage

This library is meant to provide utility functions for password storage. It is written in C# against .NET Core 2.2.

It currently only supports Argon2 calibration features. You can use this library to determine which parameters to pass to one of the Argon2 hashing functions.

This application is built upon the research in [this blog post](https://www.twelve21.io/how-to-choose-the-right-parameters-for-argon2/).

## Documentation

First, clone the git repository.

```
git clone https://https://github.com/bburman/Twelve21.PasswordStorage.git
```

Secondly, enter the directory and build the solution, or the Docker image.

```
# Either locally
dotnet build
# Or using Docker
docker build . -t password-storage
```

Next, run the Argon2 Calibration function.

```
# Either locally
cd ./Twelve21.PasswordStorage
dotnet run a2c
# Or using Docker
docker run -it password-storage a2c
```

The application will run and show you the best results, similar to:

```
Best results:
M =  256 MB, T =    2, d = 8, Time = 0.732 s
M =  128 MB, T =    6, d = 8, Time = 0.99 s
M =   64 MB, T =   12, d = 8, Time = 0.968 s
M =   32 MB, T =   24, d = 8, Time = 0.896 s
M =   16 MB, T =   49, d = 8, Time = 0.973 s
M =    8 MB, T =   96, d = 8, Time = 0.991 s
M =    4 MB, T =  190, d = 8, Time = 0.977 s
M =    2 MB, T =  271, d = 8, Time = 0.973 s
M =    1 MB, T =  639, d = 8, Time = 0.991 s
```

For detailed help and options, add the --help option to the command line:

```
# Either a local binary
> dotnet run a2c -- --help
# Or using Docker
> docker run -it password-storage --help


Usage:  a2c [options]

Options:
  -?|-h|--help      Show help information
  -t|--time         The maximum time in milliseconds it should take to calculate the password hash. Defaults to 1000.
  -p|--parallelism  The degree of parallelism. Defaults to twice the number of CPU cores.
  -i|--iterations   The minimum number of iterations. Defaults to 2.
